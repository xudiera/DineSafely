# DineSafely

## What is DineSafely?

DineSafely displays Toronto Public Health’s food safety inspections for all establishments that serve and prepare food. Each inspection results in either a pass, a conditional pass, or a closed notice. The data is sourced from the [City of Toronto's Open Data Portal](https://open.toronto.ca/).
